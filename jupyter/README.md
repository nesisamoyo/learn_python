<h1> Variables and types </h1>
<h2>Variable and types are needed to make program operations, like adding numbers, understand how programs flow. </h2>
<h2>A variable has a type, in Python, among them integer, float, string, list, and dictionaries. Learn why types in Python are important to master. They enable you to use specific functions, like Math functions, manipulate specific string operations, and more.</h2>
<h2> To format a string, you use f for formatted with curly brackets {}: </h2>
  For example:
    Since we can only concatenate strings:
      you can do this:
        a = 1
        print(f"I am string with an integer {a} - and more text") -> This outputs I am a string with an integer 1 - and more text
        print(f"I am string with an integer {a + 1} - and more text") -> This outputs I am a string with an integer 3 - and more text
